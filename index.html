				<h3>The techniques we use are in our physiotherapy center:<h3>
				<h4>CRYOTHERAPY</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
							Cryotherapy is the use of cold for therapeutic purposes. By applying cold and reducing tissue temperature, the following physiological effects can be achieved: decreased local blood flow (vasoconstriction), decreased metabolic rate and decreased excitability of muscles and nerves. These in turn result in therapeutically desirable effects, such as the reduction of local edema/fluid accumulation and reduction of inflammatory mediators and cell oxygen demand, which in turn protect the affected tissues from additional damage due to uncontrolled inflammation.Cold also helps to reduce pain due to the decreased excitability of free nerve endings and reduction of muscle spasm because muscle spindles become less prone to uncontrolled contraction.
                        </li>
					</ul>
                </div>
				<h4>THERMOTHERAPY</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
						Thermotherapy is the application of heat to the tissues, using various means of surface or deep heating like diathermy, IR light and heat pads.Depending on the method used, tissue at different depths can be reached. Deep heating methods are especially beneficial since the therapist is able to bypass the skin and underlying fat layer and deliver heat directly to the underlying muscles, tendons, ligaments or bones. Heat has been shown to have many beneficial effects which can be used in treating a wide variety of conditions. The most important physical effects are increased blood flow, decreased chronic inflammation, decreased joint stiffness with increased tendon extensibility and general muscle relaxation.
                        </li>
					</ul>
                </div>
				<h4>ULTRASOUND</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
							Ultrasound is a method of stimulating tissue using very high frequency sound waves. This has both thermal and non-thermal effects in the treated area.The heat produced during treatment delivers all the known benefits of thermotherapy, like increased blood flow and reduced chronic inflammation. Additionally, due to the special properties of ultrasound, treatment can also be delivered at significant depths of 5+ cm, effectively reaching even areas that other modalities can’t. In addition, non-thermal effects like stable cavitation (formation of microscopic vibrating gas bubbles) are thought to be able to directly stimulate cell membranes, enhancing cell repair effects.
                        </li>
					</ul>
                </div>
				<h4>ELECTROTHERAPY/TENS</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
							Tens (short for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) utilizes special electrical signals to activate A-beta nerve fibers, which in turn inhibit other nerve pathways that transmit pain signals to the brain. This concept is known as the gate control theory and essentially results in reduced pain perception.It is also thought that this type of nerve stimulation increases the release of endogenous opioids known as endorphins and encephalin. These work as an internal analgesic medication, providing prolonged pain relief, even after the electrical stimulus has stopped.
                        </li>
					</ul>
                </div>
				<h4>ELECTROTHERAPY/EMS</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
							EMS (Electrical Muscle Stimulation) is the elicitation of muscle contraction by the use of electric impulses. It is an important and widely accepted tool in physiotherapy. It can be used both as a way to strengthen and improve tone of the muscles in healthy persons like athletes and as a rehabilitation tool for partially or totally immobilized patients, reducing the negative effects of disuse muscle atrophy.
                        </li>
					</ul>
                </div>
				<h4>ELECTROTHERAPY/OTHER USES</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
							Sufficient literature data exists, indicating that electrotherapy can also be used to positively affect local circulation in the area it is applied to. The increased flow of arterial blood, venous blood and lymph results in better tissue oxygenation, faster removal of metabolic byproducts and better balancing of extracellular fluid. As a result of all these effects, it is possible to achieve reduction of both acute and chronic edema, enhance tissue repair and speed up wound healing.Finally, in the form of iontophoresis, electrical currents can be used as a means of delivering pharmacological agents to a targeted area. This helps concentrate the medicine where it’s needed and completely bypasses the usual medicine routes of delivery through the gastrointestinal and circulatory system.
                        </li>
					</ul>
                </div>
				<h4>MANIPULATION THERAPY</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
							Manual therapy (also known as tissue manipulation therapy) involves a wide range of techniques where the skilled practitioner uses his hands to manipulate the patient’s body. Some of the techniques used are the various forms of massage, techniques like the Mulligan’s concept, PNF stretching and myofascial release techniques. The desired effect can be as varied as providing relaxation, increasing range of motion or correcting positioning problems. They can also be used to modulate pain, facilitate movement and enhance tissue repair. A well-trained therapist is familiar with many techniques and he is able to select the appropriate form of manual therapy for a given condition or diagnosis in cooperation with the patient.
                        </li>
					</ul>
                </div>
				<h4>THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE</h4>
				<div>
					<ul class="services">
                        <li class="services-description">
							Therapeutic exercise is a form of targeted exercise that focuses on training specific muscles or body areas in order to regain or maintain strength, endurance, flexibility or balance. It can be used to enable ambulation, release contractions of tendons or muscle spasm, improve stability and coordination of movement or even speed up recovery and restore fitness after setbacks like a surgery or an injury. The therapist will supervise the execution of the exercise to ensure it is performed correctly and safely. He will also provide help when needed and make adjustments as the condition improves.  Finally, if maintenance exercise is needed, he will teach you how to perform it on your own after completion of your therapy.
